CREATING SERVICE:

1. Create file "some-service.service.ts":

        export class SomeClass {
            someFunction(arg: type) {
                do something
            }
        }
    
    Add service to top of the tree so it inherits to all children (app.module.ts) @NgModule / @Component decorator:
    
        providers: [SomeClass]


2. Use the service by adding it to component constructor:

        constructor(private someClass: SomeClass,
                    private otherService: OtherService) {}

    Child components inherit services so you can add them as necessary:

        providers: [OtherService]

    Note that Otherservices are now overwritten from any higher level OtherServices injections


3. Access the service in the component:

    this.someClass.someFuction(arg)

4. It's possible to import services to services, needs @Injectable decorator, can add Injectable() also just in case:

    import {OtherService} from 'xxx'

    @Injectable()
    export class SomeClass {

        constructor(private otherService: OtherService) {}

        someFunction(arg: type) {
            do something
        }
    
        otherService.someF() {
            do something
        }
    }
